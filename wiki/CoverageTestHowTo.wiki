#summary How to run a coverage test with Android SDK r15
#labels Phase-Support

= Preconditions =

This howto assumes that:

 * ant is installed and its _bin_ subdirectory is in the System Path
 * the Android SDK is installed and its _tools_ and _platform-tools_ subdirs are in the System Path
 * the crawler source code is ready to compile under the %CRAWLER_DIR% directory (you might eventually work on a copy of the original dir)
 * the application under test is %APP_NAME%
 * the source for the application under test is under %APP_DIR%
 * a virtual device (AVD) is running or a physical device is connected to the computer

= Preparation =

The following steps are required in order to run the test:

 * the file Resources.java has the application specific parameters
 * the Android Manifest is updated with the correct target package for the instrumentation %APP_PACKAGE%
 * the androidtest.jar has been updated to the last version and copied in the /libs directory of the crawler

= Build =

In order to build the .apk for both the app and the crawler, open the system shell and run the following commands:

{{{
cd %APP_DIR%
android update project --path .
cd %CRAWLER_DIR%
android update test-project -p %CRAWLER_DIR% --main %APP_DIR%
ant emma debug
}}}

= Run =

In order to install both packages on the device, just use the following:

{{{
adb install -r %APP_DIR%\%APP_NAME%-instrumented.apk
adb install -r %CRAWLER_DIR%\%APP_NAME%Test-debug.apk
}}}

Then, run the test with the coverage flag on true:

{{{
adb shell am instrument -w -e coverage true com.nofatclips.crawler/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner
}}}

Open another shell and run

{{{
adb logcat *:I
}}}

to read the log. (Remove the filter for the whole thing!)

= Report Generation =

Emma will generate the coverage.ec file on the device under `/data/data/%APP_PACKAGE%/files/coverage.ec`

(the actual location will be shown in the adb console.)

Pull it from the device into the crawler directory, then use the following command to generate an HTML report:

{{{
java -cp lib\emma_device.jar emma report -r html -in %CRAWLER_DIR%\coverage.em,%CRAWLER_DIR%\coverage.ec
}}}

The report can now be found at `%CRAWLER_DIR%\coverage\` (the actual location will be shown in the console.)
